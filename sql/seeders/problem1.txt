You are given n one-dimensional segments (each segment is denoted by two integers — its endpoints). Lets define the function f(x) as the number of segments covering point x (a segment covers the point x if l≤x≤r, where l is the left endpoint and r is the right endpoint of the segment).
An integer point x is called ideal if it belongs to more segments than any other integer point, i. e. f(y)<f(x) is true for any other integer point y. 
You are given an integer k. Your task is to determine whether it is possible to remove some (possibly zero) segments, so that the given point k becomes ideal.
